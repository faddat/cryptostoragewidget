POC for a widget that pays for content storage 

POS blockchains offer a relatively inexpensive home for immutable data.  Once initial bugs are worked out, this is going to be a system that allows users to post content cheaply to the V Systems blockchain, and later, the Cosmos blockchain as well.  Think of it as immutable storage arbitrage.  The first use-case will probably be IPFS hashes, and a later one that I've thought of is a GPS location tracker.  

# Thesis
The dawn of plenty of cheap POS chains means that immutable storage is getting much cheaper.  This is a tool to allow you to access that storage.
